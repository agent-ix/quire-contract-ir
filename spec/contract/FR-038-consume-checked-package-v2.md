# FR-038: Consume the CheckedPackage V2 contract and refuse every other version

## Description

When Contract IR receives checked-package bytes, the consumer shall parse
`contract_version` exactly once before any further decoding, admit a
`quire.checked-package/v2` package only after re-deriving every package and
nominal node identity, and lower admitted items independently. Any other
contract version is refused with a typed `unknown_contract_version` code.

## Inputs

Untrusted wire bytes; caller-selected read limits; package evidence holding
the authoritative raw-artifact digests (from supplied bytes or a verified
digest store), the authoritative `sha256-jcs` domain-package digests, and the
reader-supported required features; for lowering, requested node keys and a
lowering profile (supported node tags, bounded-domain requirement, work
limit).

The normative producer contract is QSpec
`proposals/checked-package-v2/` at
`agent-ix/quire-specification@5626bc8fcfc2c280e6486aa9757930d8d87add06`,
vendored byte-exact under `tests/fixtures/checked-package/` with a
`PROVENANCE` file naming each source path, blob and SHA-256.

## Outputs

- A closed read result: admitted, refused (typed code and structural path) or
  incomplete (limit kind, limit, consumed).
- One lowering record per requested item: `lowered`, `unsupported`,
  `requires_bound`, `invalid_input` or `failed`.

## Behavior

The reader shall measure raw bytes against the byte limit, parse strict JSON
once (duplicate members refuse, nesting charged against the depth limit),
require canonical bytes, and read `contract_version` exactly once. It shall
admit only `quire.checked-package/v2`; any other version, or a missing or
malformed `contract_version`, refuses before any version-specific decoding
begins. This is a refusal control, not a compatibility layer: it never
relabels, converts or widens the input to fit the current contract.

The reader shall recompute `package_id` as the SHA-256 of the RFC 8785
canonical bytes of `identity_preimage` under `quire.package.semantic/v2`,
require the preimage's lock members to equal the lock, and require its
`identity_projection` to equal the occurrence-free projection of the graph in
graph order. It shall check each digest's declared domain before its bytes,
each locked source/definition byte digest against the read context's raw
artifact evidence and each selected `sha256-jcs` domain package digest against
its separately typed domain package evidence, every
required feature against the reported `available` capability and the
reader-supported feature set, every node tag, family form and semantic term,
reference and dependency resolution, cycles outside one explicit
`recursion_group`, and the total source map.

When a node is an enum declaration, enum member, dimension or declared unit, the
reader shall reconstruct the closed nominal preimage, require
`node_id.digest` to equal the SHA-256 of its canonical bytes, require the owner
to join an exact lock selection (source and definition owners by authority and
identity, model owners by domain package identity with a nonempty IR node
identity), and enforce identifier, canonical-integer,
reduced-rational, member/term order, duplicate/zero-exponent, root/non-root
unit, base-dimension and cross-field (`semantic_type`, dependencies, enum
literal body) rules. Any violation refuses as `invalid_semantic_graph`; a
nominal form without its preimage, or a non-nominal form carrying one, refuses
the same way.

When a caller lowers requested items, the lowerer shall charge work per request and, for each visited reachable node, per node, per body term and per successor edge, return
`invalid_input` for an absent node key, `unsupported` when any reachable node's
tag is outside the profile, `requires_bound` when the profile requires bounds
and a reachable unbounded numeric, text or collection type has no reachable
`bounded_domain` typed by it, and `failed` at the work limit. A lowered record
carries the node, its exact source-map entries, semantic type, reachable
dependency keys, bounding domain keys, reachable claim keys and a
`quire.contract-ir.semantic/v1` digest. A non-lowered record carries no node.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-038-AC-1 | Each vendored fixture admits; an unknown, empty, absent or malformed `contract_version` refuses as `unknown_contract_version` or `malformed_wire` before any version-specific decoding; and the strict parse (duplicate-member, noncanonical) refusals occur before a version is selected. | Test (TC-048) |
| FR-038-AC-2 | The reader refuses malformed, duplicate-member, unknown-member, noncanonical, stale-dependency, cross-domain digest, unknown required capability, unsupported node tag, invalid graph and invalid source-map inputs with exactly those codes, and every vendored adverse structural mutation returns its recorded outcome, before exposing a package; a retired compiled-model lock reference or owner (`authority`, `revision`, `export`) refuses as `unknown_member`, a domain package selection outside `sha256-jcs` as `digest_domain_mismatch`, one whose digest is attested only as a raw artifact as `stale_dependency`, and a `model_export` semantic form as `invalid_semantic_graph`. | Test (TC-048) |
| FR-038-AC-3 | Exact byte, depth, node, edge, occurrence, diagnostic and work limits admit a package; each one-over limit returns `incomplete` with that limit kind, the limit and the consumed counter and no package. | Test (TC-048) |
| FR-038-AC-4 | The recomputed package id equals each vendored fixture id; editing a source-map region, occurrence, raw source digest or capability disposition leaves it unchanged, while editing the edition, a selection, a required feature or a node projection changes it and refuses unless mirrored. | Test (TC-048) |
| FR-038-AC-5 | Every vendored node-identity vector re-derives its recorded digest; a package carrying every vector admits; every vendored invalid mutation, an absent or wrong preimage, and each retained-preimage change of enum case, `semantic_type`, dependency or unit target refuses as `invalid_semantic_graph`; a model owner admits when its identity names a selected domain package and refuses as `invalid_semantic_graph` when it names none or carries an empty node. | Test (TC-048) |
| FR-038-AC-6 | Every admitted node family lowers independently with exact source, type, dependency, bound and claim correspondence; missing, unsupported, unbounded and over-work requests return `invalid_input`, `unsupported`, `requires_bound` and `failed` without a node and without changing sibling records. | Test (TC-050) |

## Dependencies

QSpec FR-322 (AC-4, AC-8, AC-10, AC-11), FR-201-AC-5 and FR-195 (AC-1 through
AC-5) own the normative V2 wire, identity-domain and lowering semantics;
TC-217 names this repository as their consumer evidence owner.
