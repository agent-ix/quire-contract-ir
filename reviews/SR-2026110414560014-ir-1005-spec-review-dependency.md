  role: context_only
  excerpt: Given a admitted checked-package/v2 and QSL `Supported` classification, the projection takes its target
    from the classification, emits the required formula and valuation request for each supported row, and each generated
    artifact is admitted by its selected owner reader. Each bounded past operator defined by QSpec FR-092 is projected
    alone under both false-extension profiles with origin-complete history; a history cutoff yields `incomplete`/`missing-history`.

## Summary

Ticket: IR-1005. Coordinated PRs: quire-contract-ir#897 and quire-integration#44. One independent review, limited to consumer input binding.

New FR-515 and FR-527 depends_on edges name the actual QSL temporal-subject and classifier owners. FR-050 remains the strict admitted-package owner, FR-043 remains native evaluation, and FR-045 remains support-table semantics. Consumer implementation lives in integration; Contract IR gains no QSL production dependency. This slice needs no new QSL carrier.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Summary | Refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | low | No findings (placeholder) | - |

## Verdict

PASS for the input-binding slice only. Full FR-350 projection, native/TL correspondence and limits remain Planned; this review does not qualify them.

## Coverage

No applicable AssuranceProfile was found in either spec tree. Original authored temporal source passes through the real QSL emitter and strict IR reader twice using the dependency-owned external model fixture. The test verifies equal classifications, distinct instance membership, each own-instance success, foreign-instance refusal, altered support refusal, retained definition authority refusal, and closure-dependent refusal. Supplied focused test evidence reports one passed, zero failed, zero ignored; focused Clippy completed successfully. No Cargo, Kani, CBMC or heavy build was run by the reviewer; final full gates remain the lead's responsibility.

QSL-1417: the checked-view consumer enablement is present, supported by the actual regression and its separate note. The legacy temporal Classification remains unbound and is not claimed repaired.

## Dependency Order

QSL FR-050 admission, FR-515 subject borrowing and FR-527 classification are enablement prerequisites for the FR-350 correspondence feature. The new directed edges are FR-515 → FR-350 and FR-527 → FR-350; both enablement surfaces precede this consumer binding check. No new reverse dependency or cycle is introduced. Remaining projection/join/limit implementation follows binding and remains Planned.
