## Summary

Ticket: IR-1366. All five FR-360 criteria are tagged by active behavioral tests. The full static matrix has 1072 criteria: 964 tagged, 83 untagged, 24 method-without-symbol, and one tagged-by-ignored-test. These whole-repository gaps are reported as pre-existing context, not attributed to this PR. Scoped changed-path inventory maps to FR-360/FR-354/FR-358; no new stubs or unowned entry point were found. Repository-wide reverse-gap assurance was not completed; no global PASS is claimed.

## Scope

- role: examined; id: FR-360-AC-1; path: spec/checked_package/functional/FR-360-charge-runtime-type-projection-with-shared-budget.md; excerpt: Each public runtime type projection, monitor-closure, runtime-reachable nominal-read, and selected unit-definition entry point requires the caller's mutable `NativeJoinBudget`; budget-aware helper variants charge allocations to that same budget. They do not route storage through `model_members::Budget` / `WorkMeter`, create a local allowance, or offer an unbudgeted runtime entry point or compatibility wrapper.
- role: examined; id: FR-360-AC-2; path: spec/checked_package/functional/FR-360-charge-runtime-type-projection-with-shared-budget.md; excerpt: Every inspected runtime declaration, closure node or edge, nominal row, identity component, and selected unit edge charges work before inspection. Every IR-owned temporary or retained allocation, clone, copied name/type, formatted unit string, and runtime-reachable `element_type` / `slot_type` result charges FR-358 logical storage to the caller's budget before allocation or copying. Exact-limit work and storage succeed; one unit below either measured requirement refuses before the first unpaid operation.
- role: examined; id: FR-360-AC-3; path: spec/checked_package/functional/FR-360-charge-runtime-type-projection-with-shared-budget.md; excerpt: A storage-limited refusal occurs before the denied allocation and returns a bounded typed budget refusal with the first unpaid resource and amount, no partial runtime view, and no uncharged owned diagnostic payload. A work-limited refusal reports the first unpaid work locus without advancing the denied charge. Any earlier admitted charges remain visible and the refused operation has no success delta.
- role: examined; id: FR-360-AC-4; path: spec/checked_package/functional/FR-360-charge-runtime-type-projection-with-shared-budget.md; excerpt: At sufficient limits, representative source and model runtime type reads, selected nominal reads, and selected unit-definition reads return the same complete values, original identities, order, and semantic refusal causes as the existing behavior. Equal input, rows, and limits produce equal values, cumulative charges, deltas, or first refusals for the original and a clone of the admitted package.
- role: examined; id: FR-360-AC-5; path: spec/checked_package/functional/FR-360-charge-runtime-type-projection-with-shared-budget.md; excerpt: Runtime projection and monitor-closure paths use budget-aware variants for `DomainModel::element_type` / `slot_type` and other helpers, charging every reachable `BTreeSet` / `Vec`, cloned name/member type, formatted unit string, and other allocation to the caller's `NativeJoinBudget` before allocation or copy. This ticket does not add storage accounting to `WorkMeter` / `model_members::Budget` or widen `model_fields`, `model_operations`, semantic-operation, state, `step_relation`, or `comparison_operands` APIs; these serve separate paths and are not called by the audited runtime/closure path. 

Changed production files examined: runtime_type_projection.rs; nominal_reads.rs; model_members.rs; exact_projection.rs and exact_projection/complete_witness.rs. Changed test files examined: model_members/tests.rs; checked_package_v2_model_fields.rs and operation_census.rs; nominal_reads.rs. TC-469 procedure and expected results examined. FR-358/FR-359/FR-354 and repository README/CLAUDE/AGENTS are context only.

## Verdict

CONDITIONAL. All five FR-360 criteria are tagged by active behavioral tests. The full static matrix has 1072 criteria: 964 tagged, 83 untagged, 24 method-without-symbol, and one tagged-by-ignored-test. These whole-repository gaps are reported as pre-existing context, not attributed to this PR. Scoped changed-path inventory maps to FR-360/FR-354/FR-358; no new stubs or unowned entry point were found. Repository-wide reverse-gap assurance was not completed; no global PASS is claimed.

## Coverage

Plan completion: not assessed

No Cargo rebuild or aggregate gate was run by this reviewer. Inspected existing receipts: one helper ownership test, four Exact helper tests, 85 model/runtime tests and 12 nominal tests pass; workspace Clippy, formatter and two-document specification validation pass. Final combined-tree gate remains lead-owned and pending. The static matrix command completed within its 45-second bound; no evidence store was used. Optional gap-analysis semantic fan-out was not requested and was skipped; mandatory code/test alignment was performed in the Rust lane. No whole-repository assurance claim is made.
