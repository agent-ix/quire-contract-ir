## Summary

`quire validate --scope . 'spec/**/*.md' --summary` reports 98/98 grammar-clean documents and zero grammar findings. The changed FR-052 statement gives the key, conflicting fact and required disposition without a vague or unallocated response.

## Scope

| ID | Path | Role | Excerpt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-052 | spec/model/functional/FR-052-source-obligation-correspondence.md | examined | `differing semantic type keys conflict, so each conflicting entry shall remain` |
| FR-052-AC-24 | spec/model/functional/FR-052-source-obligation-correspondence.md | examined | Conflicting inventory facts (two `SemanticNode` rows with one `CheckedNodeId` node key and differing `semantic_type: CheckedNodeId` facts) receive their named deterministic disposition, `ConflictingIdentity`; each conflicting entry remains inspectable, and no occurrence under a conflicting node enters an accepted relation. |
| TC-452 | spec/model/matrix/TC-452-source-obligation-correspondence.md | examined | Planned until the `SemanticNode` type change and conflicting-facts test land. |
| TC-452 matrix row | spec/model/matrix/tests.md | examined | AC-24, split from AC-3, is Planned until Linear IR-820 settles the `SemanticNode` fact. |
| CheckedSemanticNodeV2 | crates/quire-contract-model/src/checked_package/v2/mod.rs | context_only | `pub semantic_type: CheckedNodeId,` |
| SourceInventoryIdentity | crates/quire-contract-model/src/source_obligation.rs | context_only | `semantic: CheckedSemanticId,` |

## Verdict

PASS. No EARS defect in the changed requirement statement.
